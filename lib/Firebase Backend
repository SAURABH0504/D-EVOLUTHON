Hello Ritwik!

Here I will tell you what i have done to implement data sending and retrieving function.

Step 1 : Just Import all the dependencies.
         Dependency 1: Firebase_core - For Initializing app with firebase i.e to connect our app with firebase.
         Dependency 2: cloud_FireStore - For Operating CRUD operations for FireStore database.

Step 2 : Now data stored in Json format so we first need to convert our data into this format before sending it to the firebase.
         Process 1 : Look in class FarmerProfile there you will see toMap function that will assign "key" : "value", You can give name to your key as per your choice but need to remember it.
                     This is because when you retrieve data from FireStore it will return the data in JSON in format "key" : "value" and we need to know key to have access to it.

Step 3 : Write function for sending Data.
         Goto class UserService here i have created a database instance _db. _db will have key to your database and will allow CRUD operation.
         CRUD.
         1. Create - For create we use set() function. This set function only accept value in JSON format. So you can see in function saveFarmerDetails()
                     i have used toMap function inside set function to send convert data into JSON Format.
                     await _db.collection('Users').doc(profile.userId).collection('Details').doc(profile.userId).set(profile.toMap(profile));
                     You Can Create Collection and doc and  give it a name as above.
                     This above Function will send Data to your Backend and store it at the given path you have Mention.
          2. Retrieve - For retrieve we use get() function. This get function only return value in JSON format. So we need to convert this JSON format into our desired
                        object and for this i have written fromFireStore() function in every Class. This take JSON format as input and convert it into an object of your class based on key.

Send Data to FireStore.
//Create Auth instance for userId and email.
FirebaseAuth auth = FirebaseAuth.instance;
          //Create Object of UserService.
          UserService user=UserService();
          //Make Object and store value in it be sure to not leave any value null.

          List<Crop> list=[Crop(cropName: 'abc'),Crop(cropName: 'abc')];

          Address address=Address(houseNo: 'abc',flatNo: 'abc',area: 'abc',road: 'abc',pinCode: 'abc',city: 'abc');

          FarmerProfile f = new FarmerProfile(farmType: 'abc',crops: list,cultivatedLand: 'abc',address: address);

          UserDetails u= new UserDetails(firstName: "hjhj",lastName: "5555",userEmail: "555",userId: "212",dob: "12121",profession: "farmer",contactNumber: "465656");

          f.farmType="Ritwik";
          f.lastName="Mehta";
          f.userEmail=auth.currentUser.email;
          f.userId=auth.currentUser.uid;
          f.dob="28/10/1999";
          f.profession="Farmer";
          f.contactNumber="9147854125";

          // Call function and pass f as an argument.

          user.saveFarmerDetails(f);

          //Hurray Data is in the Database.
